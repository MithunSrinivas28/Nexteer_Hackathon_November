## 🚗 Smart Parking System – Data-Driven Intelligent Parking Solution

### **Concept Overview**

This project reimagines urban parking using **IoT + Computer Vision + Cloud integration**.
The system automatically **detects vehicles**, **reads license plates**, and **logs entry/exit data** in real time.
All data is synced to **Google Sheets** for cloud logging and displayed on a **local web dashboard**, enabling smarter parking management.

### **System Components**

1. **ESP32-CAM** – Captures vehicle images at the parking entrance/exit.
2. **Ultrasonic Sensor** – Detects vehicle presence in each slot (or entry point).
3. **Number Plate Recognition (OpenCV + API)** – Extracts and identifies the vehicle number.
4. **Google Sheets (Apps Script Integration)** – Stores timestamp, slot ID, and vehicle number.
5. **Local Web Dashboard** – Displays live parking data and analytics from Sheets (using Google Sheets API or Apps Script web app).
